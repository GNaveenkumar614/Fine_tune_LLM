# Getting an Overview on Fine-tuning LLMs

## Understand When to Apply Fine-tuning on LLMs
- Identify use cases where pre-trained models fall short
- Determine if task-specific adaptation is needed
- Evaluate whether prompt engineering is insufficient for your requirements

## Prepare Your Data for Fine-tuning
- Collect and clean domain-specific data
- Format data according to model requirements (JSON, CSV, etc.)
- Split data into training, validation, and test sets
- Consider data augmentation techniques if needed

## Train and Evaluate an LLM on Your Data
- Choose appropriate fine-tuning method (full, LoRA, QLoRA, etc.)
- Set hyperparameters (learning rate, batch size, epochs)
- Monitor training metrics (loss, accuracy)
- Evaluate model performance on held-out test set
- Compare against baseline models
